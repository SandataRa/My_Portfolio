# [Project 1: Comparing World Trends in 1960 and 2013](https://github.com/SandratraR/20Days_DataScience_2021/blob/master/WorldTrends_Homework.py)
Using the dataset provided by [SuperDataScience](https://sds-platform-private.s3-us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/P4-Section5-Homework-Challenge.pdf), this project presents a comparative analysis of the world's **Life Expectancy** and **Birth Rate** per **Countries Regions** in **1960** and **2013**: 
* Y Axis: Life Expectancy by Countries Regions (unit: Number of years)
* X Axis: Birth Rate by Countries Regions (unit: Number of live births / 1 000 inhabitants)

# [Project 2: EDA on Employee Attrition & Performance](https://github.com/SandratraR/20Days_DataScience_2021/blob/master/Day12.py)
Using the dataset [IBM HR Analytics](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset), this project in an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) useful to analyze attrition within your company. Such a project aims to identify the reasons pushing top performer employees to leave the company. Here are all the observations we obtained after analysis:   
* The peak of attrition concerns men between 25-35 years old, working in Research & Development department.
