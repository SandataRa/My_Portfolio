# [US Airlines Bumpings 2016 - 2017](https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/resources/individuals/aviation-consumer-protection/300341/2017-december-atcr.pdf)

Using The Air Travel Consumer monthly report, this project provides charts displaying evolution of bumpings *(passengers have to give up their seats because there are more passengers scheduled to fly on an airplane than available seats.)* for each US airlines.  

The result is an Excel file containing the dataset formatted with added charts displaying the situation for each company from 2016 to 2017. Such reports can be used for presentation purposes or internal communications.
